This Document Analyzer software was developed for the Westminster College Sociology Department. 
It allows the user to parse through several documents for keywords they have created. 
These keywords each belong to a theme as stipulated by the user. 
Running the analyzer generates two documents: The first is a Microsoft Word document that list any paragraph from the 
orignal document set that contained one or more of the keywords the user searched for. The keywords themselves are 
highlighted in a color that is once again set by the user. The second document is a Microsoft Excel file that tells the
user how often each keyword showed up in their documents, and gives them an idea of their relative importance.
